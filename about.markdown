I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at **Meta**, working on ads ranking — building large-scale ML systems that serve billions of ad impressions daily.

Outside of work, I spend my time exploring things I find interesting:

**Algorithmic Trading** — I've traded and built strategies around market microstructure, statistical arbitrage, and low-latency execution. The intersection of math, speed, and markets is where I started.

**AI Agents** — I've been building autonomous agents that can browse the web, shop for groceries, generate research reports, and interact with complex environments. This is where I think things are heading.

**Machine Learning** — From deep learning and NLP to reinforcement learning — I enjoy going deep on both the theory and the engineering side.
